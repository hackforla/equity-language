# Contributors Wanted

We are looking for help in these areas:


## Marketing communications (MC) and public relations (PR). 

The core idea is that we’re ready to reach out to people about the project, explain what we are, what we’re seeking, who we want to reach, and how to use our tools. This would be great for someone who wants to get involved in the mix of social media, public relations, and especially connecting with other brigades. Christina is the best first contact for this area.

## User experience (UX) Research and Design

The core idea is we want to interview many more people about what we’re doing, both for the project mission and also for specific guidance on what we could build next. This role especially leans into user research, Subject Mater Expert interviews, prototyping, and user testing. Charlotte is the best first contact for this area.

## JavaScript coder

The core idea is writing vanilla JavaScript to search text, highlight results, and coach users how to change their words. This is a lot like writing a spell-checker. We are discussing implementations such as in-page editing, and creating a Chrome extension, and looking at integrations with existing popular tools for writers. Joel is the best first contact for this area.

## Business analyst (BA) 

This includes figuring out value stream maps and change management capabilities. Joel is the best first contact for this area.


## Subject Mater Experts

We would love help from any subject matter experts: linguists, community organizers, activists advocating for change, etc. who may be able to advise us to make a tool that creates the most positive impact on language use on the web. Charlotte would be the best first contact.


## Anything Else!

If you're interested in helping to make a change to the language we use for the better and have ideas about how we could improve, feel free to join us.


We meet on Wednesdays 7-8:30pm PT on zoom.
