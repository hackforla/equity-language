## Project Video Script (WIP - Feel free to modify)

Hi, my name is [NAME], and I'm a [ROLE] on Write for All.

Write for All is working to create a tool that can search website text, flag instances of non-inclusive language, and provide education in order to create a more inclusive web. 

Our goal is to help make content on the web more inclusive towards all genders, LGBTQ+ people, and more. 

Think about Write for All as making a Grammarly for inclusive language. 

Here are 3 examples:

We would flag...
* Fireman, and suggest "firefighter,"
* Stewardess and suggest "flight attendant"
* "Sexual preference," and suggest "sexual orientation" 

Following each suggestion, we'd have some education so that users would be able to make the right editing decisions.

We are currently looking for:
* UX developer
* JavaScript programmer
* QA coder
* DevOps engineer 
* Gender/sexuality researcher
* Communications writer AND
* Videographer

Feel free poke around in our GitHub or slack our channel if you have any questions. Go through our readme for more about the roles we're recruiting for. 

Join Write for All and help move the needle towards a more inclusive web.
