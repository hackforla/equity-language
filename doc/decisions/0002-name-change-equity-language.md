# Change project name: gender-equity â†’ to equity-language 

## Status

accepted

## Context

We realized that we were looking out for language that is inclusive to more than gender-related groups
We also thought about changing our name to just "equity" but it is just too broad of a name, and is not great for SEO. :) 

## Decision

Change name to equity-language from gender-equity

## Consequences

A name that is more aligned / less restrictive
