# Decide design tool for visual assets

Status: accepted

Summary: We decided to use Figma because it is free (vs. $99 sketch app), and makes collaboration easier. Figma is like the google docs of design. (Vs. Sketch, where we would have to download separate version control software)



## Issue

We are deciding this now, because in the past, having various designers work on different tools is a nightmare to coordinate. 
While most designers are using Sketch these days, there are still people who don't use it for various reasons (Sketch only runs on macs). We want to be inclusive to all who want to join our group.
